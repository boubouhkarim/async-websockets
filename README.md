### Welcome to my websockets repository.
This repository is a collection of scripts that I wrote throughout my journey in the topic.
These scripts utilize the asyncio and websockets modules of python.

> Make sure you use the python 3.7.0 x86 edition or newer BUT x86 edition.
> I would use a virtual environment to install the 'websockets','websocket-client' modules
